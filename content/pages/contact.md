This page is dedicated to verifying myself on other platforms. So, without further ado:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/Pandentia)
- [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) encryption key: `age1y5fd8v5mv0720futu3h4s52mhn3hakjc8a3p8z3gqxpa4dj6sp0sw7gzw0`
- GPG fingerprint: `BDFC062F3897235495AF49034E7BE3BB14CB524D` on keyserver `keys.openpgp.org`
- Email: Replace the first `.` in the domain name with an `@`.

You may be surprised by the absence of social media on this page, and on my blog in general (no share buttons). This is not a mistake, and is a stance I may write more about in future.
