Hi, I guess. Introductions time.

<!--more-->

I'm an 18-year-old girl currently living in Germany, in the middle of nowhere, trying to sort out my life. I have a fondness for computers, which led to me setting up my own servers and eventually starting to write my own software, the latter of which appeals to me because I like building things, and software is free for me to build. Some might even go as far to call me a sysadmin or a software developer but, as with many things, I feel that I don't really fit into either category. I just enjoy working with computers.

Some of the services I've built or set up include a [journaling app for myself](https://github.com/Pandentia/journal), a [federated microblogging instance](https://fedi.qcx.io), a [Redmine instance](https://redmine-pandentia.qcx.io) (used as a to-do list), various Discord bots, a [protocol multiplexer](https://github.com/Pandentia/protoplex), this very blog, and a [personal API](https://cassandra.beelen.one/api/meta). This is by no means an extensive list, I've honestly lost track of how many services I run. I plan to go into detail on how all of this ties together in a future post. Suffice it to say, for now, a lot of virtual machines and Docker containers.

So yeah, that's me. Hello, world.
