There's not much point in me hiding it anymore. Remember that [trauma that I referenced]({{< ref "posts/../hi-again.md" >}}) last post?

Yeah. That's this.

## Being trans

So, what even is being transgender? Being trans means that I was born into a body that didn't cooperate with my brain. My brain wanted estrogens, my body produced androgens, and no one helped me. I, or rather we[^1], remember this starting at about three years of age.

We have another early memory of mentioning it to our mother and getting laughed at.[^2] I doubt she even remembers. We do.

## The "cure"

So how do you go about curing such a condition? You change the one variable in the equation that you *can* change. The body. Even if you wanted to change the brain itself, that's a part of our identity. And identity is immutable, if the bloody history of conversion therapy has taught us anything.

To cut a long rant short, we didn't get that help. We suffered.

Before puberty it was an annoyance we could deal with, afterwards... it was pure, unadulterated hell. We spent more than 8 years in that hell. If you're observant, you might now have noticed why we sometimes speak in the plural form.[^1]

It's a miracle that we survived our suicide attempts, attempts that I *didn't even know about* until mid-2020. They happened in 2014. That's how deep this rabbit hole goes.

Regardless, that completely unnecessary trauma is what's forcibly being done to children in the UK and Arkansas right now, under the guise of protecting children from "experimentation". These politicians know what they're doing. They're using us as a cheap gambit to gain voters, with children's blood on their hands.

## The silver lining

Oh, I'm sorry, you expected a positivity post out of me because this is trans day of visibility and not remembrance?

The silver lining is, I'm now more educated than 99% of society on the intricacies and immutability of (gender) identity. I'm an anarchist, and an antifascist, because I see my healthcare getting cut short by the fascists every day and nothing is being done to combat it.

I now suffer from undiagnosed complex PTSD, or C-PTSD for short. I have undiagnosed DID. I'm misdiagnosed with autism. Along with at least another handful of disorders that I can't remember.

Now for the love of all that is holy, [go and donate to some trans charities](https://twitter.com/Tonya_Song/status/1376681159745101825).
