Wow it's been a while, huh. I've been up to a lot of things, so I'm not sure exactly where to begin.

<!--more-->

## Cassiecluster

I've been building a cluster with [Terraform](https://terraform.io), [Packer](https://packer.io), [Ansible](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)>), [Vault](https://vaultproject.io), [Consul](https://consul.io), [Nomad](https://nomadproject.io) and [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula). [Here's the repo for that.](https://github.com/SapphicCode/cassiecluster)

It's been tough work, but I've got it glued together, more or less.

## Personal life

Oh don't get me started. Let's see, I've:

- Taken up photography
- Left my childhood home
- Moved most of my stuff into the cloud
- Made a journal
- Processed way too much trauma
- Moved in with my girlfriend
- Built my own cluster (see above)
- Gotten evicted with my girlfriend

And that's just off the top of my head. Trauma memory loss being what it is, I can't say I remember much of my past in detail, for better or worse.

I want to write more on that, but I'm biting my tounge for now. Watch this space, I guess.
